      <div class="district-content">
          <p>Trivandrum is the capital of the southern state of Kerala. The place is known for its 
            idyllic beaches and rich culture because of which it draws tourists from all over the
              country. Trivandrum is also one of the cleanliest cities in India. Even after being 
              the capital city and one of the most developed cities of the state it is still a far 
              call from the maddening rush of the metropolitans. Hill stations, serene beaches,
              backwaters and lagoons make it an ideal holiday destination. The place is also well
                known for its diverse flora and fauna and is also a major attraction for medical 
                tourists learning Ayurveda.
