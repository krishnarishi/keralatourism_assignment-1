            <p> 
                Kerala is known for its impeccable beaches, and Thrissur has its own contribution 
                too. Famous as a wonderful spot for kids to plan their picnics, honeymooners to 
                relax, and for others to have their own beach fun, Chavakkad Beach is a must visit 
                in the city. The golden sand, the sound of waves crashing against the rocks, and the 
                sunset view makes it a little paradise in the city.

                legends make it an old-world charm, which is definitely worth witnessing on your trip.
