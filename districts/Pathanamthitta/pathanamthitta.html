            A hilly province of pristine splendour, the district of Pathanamthitta is hailed as the
            headquarters of pilgrim worship in Kerala. Three rivers course through its prosperous 
            terrains comprising natural divisions of the lowlands, the midlands and the highlands.
            Interspersed with temples, rivers, mountain ranges and coconut groves, more than
            fifty per cent of the total area of this region is covered by forests.

              <p> 
                Gavi is a carefully-protected natural reserve inhabited by some of the rarest and 
                most elusive animals known to man. That’s why you have to be quiet, and carry your 
                own litter when in Gavi. The local authorities, along with the villagers, go to great
                engths to maintain this ecological vault of sorts. Gavi is a great place to go to 
                trekking, but you have to be accompanied by forest officials wherever you go. The way
                the people treat Mother Nature will create deep respect for Gavi, making it one of the
                top tourist spots in Pathanamthitta.
