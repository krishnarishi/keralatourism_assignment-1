          <p>
            Ernakulam refers to the eastern, mainland portion of the twin cities of Ernakulam-Kochi
             in central Kerala, India. Located on the coast of the Arabian Sea, Ernakulam is a 
             booming business metropolis. It is often referred to as the commercial capital of Kerala.
             Ernakulam has been a part of human settlements since the Stone Age. Rock-cut caves and dolmens
             are still a part of this city. Ernakulam was ruled by the Chera Dynasty and later, by the 
             Kingdom of Cochin (Perumpadapu Swaroopam).

              <p> 
                Located on the north end of Vypin island in Kochi, Cherai beach is a 15 km stretch of 
                wild and rugged beauty. Although not overwhelmed by hotels or major restaurants, the beach 
                is dotted with small shacks selling local snacks like pakoras and chips. Stunning lagoons, 
                wide paddy fields and coconut grooves adorn the road to the beach. Ernakulam sightseeing is
                not complete without a visit to Cherai beach.

              <p> 
                One of the first bird sanctuaries in Kerala and undeniably a haven for nature enthusiasts. 
                In the words of Salim Ali (world famous ornithologist), Thattekkad is the “richest bird sanctuary
                in India” since it is home to hundreds of different endangered species of migratory birds. This
                thick deciduous forest has plantations of mahogany, teak, rosewood and rubber running through
                it. Make sure to bring along a pair of binoculars to get a glimpse of the birdlife. The best 
                time to visit would be between November and March.

            <p> 
                Vypeen is one of the popular places to visit in Ernakulam in one day. A short and beautiful 
                ferry ride from the city will take to this serene island which is dotted with beaches,
                backwaters and an array of restaurants and hotels. A desktop worthy scenery away from the
                bustling environment is what makes Vypeen island one of the best places to visit in 
                Ernakulam for lovers.
